## Application Structure

The app consists of **8 classes** and corresponding XML layouts:

1. **MainActivity** — Welcome screen. (`activity_main.xml`)
2. **HomeActivity** — Home screen with calorie counter. (`activity_home.xml`)
3. **ExerciseActivity** — Choose workouts. (`activity_exercise.xml`)
4. **ProfileActivity** — View and sort workout history and profile settings. (`activity_profile.xml`)
5. **SettingsActivity** — Manage personal details. (`activity_settings.xml`)
6. **RunningJoggingActivity** — Running/Jogging workouts.
7. **HikingActivity** — Hiking workouts.
8. **CyclingActivity** — Cycling workouts *(Design ready, implementation in progress).*

### Database Structure

The application uses **Room** for local persistence, with two main tables:

1. **UserProfile**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `name` (String)  
   - `caloriesLimit` (Integer)  
   - `photoUri` (String — URI to profile image)  

2. **CaloriesTracker**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `userId` (Foreign Key → UserProfile.id)  
   - `calories` (Integer)  
   - `consumedCalories` (Integer)  
   - `date` (String — in `yyyy-MM-dd` format)  

This design allows each user to have a persistent profile and maintain daily calorie logs.
